PCBox is a PC emulator focused on accuracy and hardware preservation above all else.
PCBox is based on the 86Box emulator.
The PCBox project is lead by [qeeg](https://github.com/qeeg).

Source code repository is at [https://github.com/PCBox/PCBox](https://github.com/PCBox/PCBox)

What can I do with PCBox?
=========================
- Learn how computers work at a low level from the source code
- Run certain demos that don't work on much else than real hardware (Like 8088MPH, for instance)
- Run old games or applications, on emulated hardware that they were designed for
